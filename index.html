                    Growing up in a family of an architect and a civil engineer, I have closely witnessed the value and
                    power
                    of design and technology since childhood. In college, however, I discovered my interest and passion
                    in
                    communication and education. When I thought I would go down a path completely off of my parents,
                    interestingly enough, all the successes and challenges I experienced in my study and work led me to
                    rethink
                    the power and value of design and technology, connecting me back to my family heritage and pointing
                    me
                    towards the job as a UX Designer. </p>

                <p>
                    I first became fascinated by the topic of incremental change when I designed the lightweight online
                    reading
                    product that I mentioned earlier. One goal of the product was to cultivate students’ habits in
                    reading and
                    learning. In designing product features to achieve the goal, I came across some interesting
                    challenges and
                    was motivated to explore behavior change theories such as Charles Duhigg’s habit loop and BJ Fogg’s
                    motivation wave. First, in light of Charles Duhigg’s theory that a habit forms through a loop
                    propelled by
                    continuous rewards, I utilized gamified rewards such as ranking, trophy, and growing avatar, into
                    my design
                    of the reading product to sustain students’ reading actions. Second, inspired by BJ Fogg’s theory
                    that a
                    designer should not rely on forcefully boosted motivation but harness whatever motivation exists at
                    the
                    moment by assigning tasks of best-suited difficulty levels (hardest task for high motivation moment
                    and
                    vice versa) to drive behavior change, I envisioned in my design of the reading product to tap into
                    user
                    context data and behavior data to recognize different students’ motivation levels at different
                    times and
                    give tasks accordingly. Of course, such feature relies on personalization technology to make it
                    happen,
                    which is another exciting area to explore that can significantly empower product and solution
                    design </p>
                <p>
                    Designing to increase information relevance is another area of my major interest. I started to
                    realize the
                    issue of information relevance when I worked at New Oriental, a private educational service
                    provider. As
                    the largest of its kind in China, the institution in Beijing alone offers more than 300 different
                    English
                    courses of varying levels, topics, teaching methods, etc. Finding the right course that fits each
                    individual student is challenging even with the aid of the course search engine and the counselors;
                    a lot
                    of assumptions about the student’s abilities have to be made and many trials and errors are needed.
                    Throughout the time managing the course, I accumulated a large pool of student engagement and
                    performance
                    data, which unfortunately were not fully exploited. I see a lot of potentials in leveraging data
                    technology
                    to offer a more personalized and thus more effective learning experience. For example, I have
                    always
                    envisioned to create and maintain digital student profiles to closely track students’ learning
                    trajectory
                    and therefrom utilize adaptive learning technology to provide dynamically adjusted content
                    throughout
                    students’ learning journey. </p>
